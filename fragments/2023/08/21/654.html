      <p class="text">even though my main website is still very much under construction, there comes a time where i have to simply start making something. this is that point, and it'll continue on through that construction and my developing of how i'd like everything to look (within my limited abilities of doing everything here on my own)</p>
      <p class="text">despite my fifth semester of university starting today as well, this more casual interface to write is one i like as way to keep some kinetic energy; i also just made it to the second part of james baldwin's <span class="i">giovanni's room</span>, and i'd love to catch up later on the reading i've (finally) gotten around to completing :></p>
