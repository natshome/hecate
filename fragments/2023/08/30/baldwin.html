      <p class="text">i finished it two nights ago, but there's a lot of praise i'll need to hand out to <span class="i">giovanni's room</span>; there's just so much there that felt incredibly familiar and touching, while still infusing enough foreign experiences—to me at least, with the travel, sexuality, etc.—that led it to be so captivating, particularly in its midsection and end</p>
      <p class="text">i guess it helps that i found a lot to relate to in the 'american traveling to europe' background of the lead, but each careful step (bar some personal 50's gripes around hella) was more and more significant as the story progressed</p>
      <p class="text">i need to start reviewing stuff formally, this is so fun :></p>
