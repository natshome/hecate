      <p class="text">this week's media diet has been a bit weirder than usual — mostly due to how pop-oriented it's been, as opposed to my recent deep-dive into the back catalog of death grips... it's been a lot of charli xcx, and i'm attached to it to an inordinate degree, right after re-listening to 10,000 gecs again.</p>
      <p class="text">i've listened to both pop 2 and charli front to back a few times, with my favorites from both having been on repeat for the whole week; how i'm feeling now has been a slow burn (which might in turn make it longer lasting in terms of enjoyment, but we'll see), though i still like the very overt hyperpop leanings of it. i don't know, i love listening to music so electronic and digital, with some of the best hooks i've ever heard :></p>
      <p class="text">apart from music, i finished sayaka murata's <span class="i">convenience store woman</span> friday night, and i want to delve deeper into that once i have some spare time; it's interesting enough to write about, but i'm not sure how much i truly love it.</p>
      <p class="text">and i urge anyone to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUXSZMIiUfFRQGbbUgQRky2-gCAFgsAiz" target="_blank">this 7 part, 9 hour long documentary on the minnesota vikings</a>; i've already watched (at least twice) both secret base's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUXSZMIiUfFSzzgEL4N9aYBXPmGVen3zW" target="_blank">atlanta falcons</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUXSZMIiUfFQua1LlKNMg1IOqAn15RkUT" target="_blank">seattle mariners</a> documentaries, and they've all been some of my favorite media on youtube — if not anywhere, especially compared to anything else related to sports. the stories are filled with beautiful humanity, stats for nerds, and a flat comedy that all feel unique to jon bois and alex rubenstein's style; i can't heap enough praise onto their work on the dorktown series.</p>
      <p class="text">please watch all three of those documentaries and get back to me... even if it takes you at least a few days start to finish for them all c:</p>
