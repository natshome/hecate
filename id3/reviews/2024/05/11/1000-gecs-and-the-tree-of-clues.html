        <p>there is no good way to describe this album in terms of the sounds being heard. that's not to say it's the best thing ever made, and i think in many ways it lacks a lot of the versatility that it should have with such a tracklist and list of collaborators, but it's an absolutely wild experience filled to the brim with ideas that, while not as succinctly appealing as its originals, are still genuinely valuable. and it contains some of their best songs overall, despite the overall inconsistency.</p>

        <p>but there's likely more merit to what images it conjures up and seems to encapsulate, instead of attempting to describe the sounds and performances that resonate the most across its 51-minute runtime. so that's what this piece will attempt to display, at least to some capacity.</p>
