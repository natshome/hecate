        <p>this feels like a necessary implosion, violently rending together so many sounds in a similar vein to Captain Beefheart had, just to get something moving faster, to put enough stuttering, grotesque electronics in loose arrangements—over obviously drowned out but absolutely resolute shouts—to give it the momentum of an asteroid.</p>

        <p>it's not put together, trimmed, or even too revelatory despite that; it's just an effervescent, proto-spark that, even if it fell by the wayside of popular eyes, the fallout left was surely felt by countless industrial, digital hardcore, and punk-ish fusing artists. <span class="i">Attention Shoppers</span> is a convergence that necessitates pushing around, sanding down, morphing its wicked atmosphere into any more singular of a delivery. because this thing has no idea where it wants to go or where it came from—which, since that feels like it was the mental home of and the needed goal to replicate, it exceeds at translating to noise. far too well.</p>

        <p>i love everything this achieves though still, despite its weird posture. the social commentaries are blurred to the point everything is this one ugly shade of... i don't know, khaki? ochre? though i'm not certain; it's probably just its own filter, the noisy aberrations cranked so high from their 'originals' that every color is imbued within it—but that when you zoom out, it appears as if there's only one mode it operates in and for. it's only when you look there, within, closely past all the glare and noxious repellent, that it executes this free, brash experimenting with no contempt, just an otherworldly drive to see something come to bear, come to life. but what an uncanny life. i'm glad there was someone to tell it this way.</p>
