        <p>isn't it a little bit disingenuous to try and rate this? i can write all i want, on how it starts and finishes on well-tread avenues realized such that it still reads as new despite its age, yet its midsection—because of that relationship it has to military control and social fabric maintenance showing more clearly—is hopelessly lacking, and on... but it does feel like trying to rate a philosophy based on enjoyment. and that's not really the point. i assume.</p>

        <p>because i also think that it would be pointless <span class="i">not</span> to comment on its subjective value, its framework, and how it acts and shifts as a collected set of ideals.</p>

        <p>despite verse #50 really just being 'live your truth and you will never die', and how there's <span class="i">so</span> much 'being quiet is good' repeated ad nauseam in different, quickly tiring metaphors; and verse 45's "Be pure like the sheen of silk" seeming to either espouse that manufactured appearances are useful tools, or that beautiful things are inherently good (if not simply a translation fault); there's useful thoughts, truly. and i can't ignore that this kind of writing, this kind of conceptual aid is much more suited to continual rereading and reinterpretation than what i'm attempting.</p>

        <blockquote>Only when the family loses its harmony<br><span class="inset">do we heart of "dutiful sons"</span><br>Only when the state is in chaos<br><span class="inset">do we hear of "loyal ministers"</span></blockquote>
        <p class="clabel">verse 18</p>

        <blockquote>Abandon plots and schemes<br>Discard profit-seeking<br><span class="inset">and the people will not become thieves</span></blockquote>
        <p class="clabel">verse 19</p>

        <blockquote>Thus, when two opponents meet<br><span class="inset">the one without an enemy</span><br><span class="inset">will surely triumph</span></blockquote>
        <p class="clabel">verse 69</p>

        <blockquote>The Sage's illness has become ill<br><span class="inset">his renunciation has been renounced</span><br>Now he is free<br>And every place in this world<br><span class="inset">is the perfect place to be</span></blockquote>
        <p class="clabel">verse 71</p>

        <blockquote>Why do the people regard death so lightly?—<br><span class="inset">Because they are so involved with their own living</span><br><span class="inset">That’s why they regard death so lightly</span><br><br>In the end,<br>The treasure of life is missed by those who hold on<br><span class="inset">and gained by those who let go</span></blockquote>
        <p class="clabel">verse 75</p><br>

        <p>the best part of these selections is that they don't simply allow, they push you towards continual rethinking, constant reattributing their meanings to different avenues of your life, your purpose, your community, your peace. or whatever they could possibly mean for you, for others. i just wished that, at this point, for all of the multiplicity these (and the collection as a whole) can apply towards, that they hit upon something that felt greater, that its ethereality could manifest more concretely.</p>

        <p>maybe i just have to keep learning it all, because maybe that's not how that mirage will show for me.</p>
