        <p>this album has been simmering for a while. though i've been listening to it nonstop since the night it released. it was a special night.</p>

        <p>there's something so innately beautiful about an album like this, seeing their progression fall in upon itself over and over again. after what has remained the best, most soul-shredding album of the decade so far in <span class="i"><a href="../../../2024/04/28/frailty.html">Frailty</a></span>, and the artistic re-evolution with the heart-rending <span class="i"><a href="../../../2024/11/12/census-designated.html">Census Designated</a></span>, they—through expansive lens focused in on their own work, their own self-image and outside perceptions, their own artistic trajectory—create one of the most explosively creative and eclectic albums ever, through crafting, in a self-assuredness of that fact, something that can't help but still doubt everything it was founded upon.</p>

        <p>and as much as they sound incredibly different, there are parallels to <span class="i">BRAT</span> released last year (thank you for the reference Danny), of crafting something <span class="i">so</span>, so catchy—that still, in its darkest moments, pulls downwards into depths of grief or desperation that cannot be summed up better than what has already been articulated on wax.</p>

        <p>there are three show-stopping sets of three on this album, with <span class="i">TWICE REMOVED</span>, <span class="i">angels in camo</span>, and <span class="i">Fadeoutz</span> splitting them up neatly; their places are still decisive though, in descending order, the overall consistency here still staggering to witness. and while <span class="i"><a href="../../01/11/jrjrjr.html">JRJRJR</a></span> is the closing moment here, it seems more valuably seen as an epilogue, with <span class="i">Dark night castle</span> as the 'true' ending to this album's moment. there is a lyrical mania in the former that keeps it almost innately tied across as its own artistic statement, eclipsing the previous eleven tracks with something so wrapped up in terribly expansive fears, doubts, and a sense of division from everything known, true or not... even if their erratic confidence appears to be at an all-time high.</p>

        <p>the foundations that influence those eleven prior steps here are reminiscent of vital figures that they've shown appreciation for or collaborated with in the past: Lucy Bedroque and d0llywood1 of course, given the tour they headlined, but there are broader marks of house, edm, hardstyle, industrial, hip-hop, and hardcore screams that lace every little inch of the album that make it so imposing. yet <span class="i">Dark night castle</span> is itself an outlier too, singularly pulling closer to the artistic tact of Chuquimamani-Condori in stretching, distorting, re-imagining, and re-forming vocal lines and melody snippets into something noisily, impenetrably grandiose. 2024's b-side <a href="../../../2024/09/11/magic-i-want-u.html">How to Teleport</a> hinted at this reverence; here they ring out and meld with the rest of the daggers around them into something somehow much greater than the sum of their parts.</p>

        <p>yet the most impactful inspiration here is of themselves. through self-reference upon self-reference, in sound and in messaging, they violently rebuild in <span class="i">Revengeseekerz</span> the subject matters that made <span class="i">JRJRJR</span> the most plainly, strenuously corrosive single of this year. they seem to continuously, repetitively narrow focus upon each little spare line that made that song such an obelisk in their catalog, in the hopes of making it known exactly what this album is for: a victory lap of artistic freedom and unbridled talent, blanket-covering nagging sensations that still creep past despite it all, ad nauseam.</p>

        <p><span class="i">Psychoboost</span> as further deconstructed progression of their loudest work under Jane and Danny Brown's vocal onslaught; <span class="i">Star people</span> as the personal affect to <span class="i">JRJRJR</span>'s antisociality; <span class="i">Experimental Skin</span> as simultaneous revering of another and self-destructively re-inventing or forgetting yourself like <span class="i">Video</span>'s allegory; <span class="i">Dreamflasher</span> as recreation of the kinds of longing-through-suffocating-fame that <span class="i"><a href="../../../2024/08/04/flash-in-the-pan.html">Flash in the Pan</a></span> and <span class="i"><a href="../../../2024/09/11/magic-i-want-u.html">Magic I Want U</a></span> sparked; <span class="i">TURN UP OR DIE</span> as third artistic eulogy for <a href="../../../2024/11/30/dariacore.html">leroy</a> despite <a href="../../../2024/10/08/grave-robbing.html">intermittent vandalism</a> (<span class="i">XO TOUR LLIF3</span> most recently), and its overbearing ecstatic backdrop as a form of super-effective escapism; <span class="i">Dancing with your eyes closed</span> as a marker for how much more effectively they can build upon their early digicore work without ever treading old ground; and <span class="i">Professional Vengeance</span> as an industrial sabotaging of the pop perfection that they can sculpt without fear.</p>

        <p>their ability to crate-dig their own work instrumentally is what makes all of those statements work 10x more gratifyingly, and paints their statements in even more aesthetically charming a light. <span class="i">Revengeseekerz</span> is a set of self-anecdotes that, despite all the longing for and from others scattered about, shows a careful reverence for your past selves, an uncertain reality and confident painting in your version of now, and a desperate hope that when it all changes, when it all crashes together to rise out again as something new, that there is some kind of touching sensibility left. something that can make the ground you kiss much more stable. whether that means putting down the mic just to reach that paradisal anchor someday, or riding it out until they meet you at sunset some unknown day, it longs that whatever, whoever it may be, will be transformative, outshining anything you could possibly dream of.</p>
