      <div class="commentbody">

        <p>i'm still trying to figure out how to fill in the gaps after removing ratings, then moving over old comments, and trying to have more deliberate fun on platforms i've been syndicating to, especially letterboxd.</p>

        <p>i liked the ability to essentially have (primarily for albums) lists of the dates when i saw/read/listened to everything for the first time; but i will say it became tedious even to me (what do i do about what i already had?), and serves no practical purpose to anyone walking through. what information is there really besides a number next to a ton of things, without reason?</p>

        <p>i don't like the added blurriness of <span class="i">not</span> having those tables, but it has overlapped nicely with feeling less tethered, able to just spit thoughts out when they actually mean something instead of simply thinking of the most fitting rating and moving on. besides, i can still have fun doing that on rym, aoty, and letterboxd. it's hard to draw the line between what i post on them and on here, which is the main reason for these three paragraphs.</p>

        <p>but the main purpose of everything here from now on is just as recap for november, and looking forward to a few things that i want to develop further. i want to come up with a nice system to be able to show favorites, best lists for release years, some charts (instead of tables) for genre dives and those best lists, and different, more creative ways to yell about things i loved, hated, or were passionately indifferent towards. that last point is what these new comments are here for at the very least, and we'll see how long it takes to develop into something meaningful.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>books</h2>

        <p>even though my reading list has stayed stagnant, i've been reading <span class="i">no longer human</span> by osamu dazai recently the most. i'm always wary of any piece of media that tries to positively take this angle of male loneliness, of ostracization because 'ugh, no one understands me, i'm different than everyone else, are humans really empathetic, are women even people', because it's so poisonous, and it rubs off in some of the worst ways imaginable often times. but i guess there is something there so far, enough that i keep going. whether it's the fact that there was immense trauma that befell both the character and the author—though i will say, most people that experience trauma don't become horrible people, so that's no excuse (though, it is a story...)—or whether it's something deeper, that there is some more important message or purpose that i desperately hope it taps into more, i'm not sure of yet. the writing style isn't flashy, but it's offbeat and flawed, uncomfortably, endearingly so.</p>

        <p>and i hope i read as much as i have going forward as i have in the past week or so; i'm about halfway through both that and <span class="i">stung with love</span> by sappho, i was eating away at <span class="i">crime & punishment</span> for a minute before my library rental of <span class="i">no longer human</span> came in, and the <span class="i">utopia of rules</span> by david graeber has a permanent seat as 'fun' sociological reading until i get through it all. school for the next upcoming year or so will dampen it a lot, i'm sure, but dealing with planning for that end and transitory period to follow is a lot (...maybe just a good amount) of motivation.</p>

        <h2>games</h2>

        <p>i reviewed <a href="../../../../reviews/2024/11/29/celeste.html">celeste</a> a few days ago now, and i'm happy about that, i think it turned out well, and i said about as much as what came through to me through playing it—at least, that i can contain within what it did and said, barring <a href="../../../../../fragments/2024/03/11/cassandra.html">a lot of the personal it stirred</a> for the sake of not repeating myself.</p>

        <p>i don't have much more to say unfortunately. i mean, i started playing <span class="i">rainbow six: siege</span> with friends, and that's been really fun despite the insane skill ceiling that i can see in it, and <span class="i">minecraft</span> has been slowing down in playtime because of everything i've already said here. but devoting time to a medium i have little experience and little current motivation for is tough, and it'll probably be a while before i get to anything new. either way though, i've had <span class="i">nier:automata</span>, <span class="i">omori</span>, <span class="i">pools</span>, <span class="i">the unfinished swan</span>, <span class="i">what remains of edith finch</span>, and <span class="i">yume nikki</span> (which i've started a bit) on my active list in steam for a little while now. i hope they sweep me up enough to really devote time to soon.</p>

        <h2>movies</h2>

        <p>i'm glad i've slightly gotten over the hump with sitting down and watching movies more deliberately often than i used to, in watching five new for the first time this month, rewatching four after a <span class="i">very</span> long time, and putting a word in for (against?) one in each of those camps.</p>

        <p>i said all i really feel <a href="../../../../reviews/2024/11/30/wicked.html">wicked</a> deserve from me, and 2001 is such a mess in my mind, so i won't belabor it and move onto something happier. <span class="i">spirited away</span> is now the only movie i've given a perfect score, which feels right; compared to what i've seen that's just lower than it in my mind, it feels like it simultaneously taps into a whole lot without feeling like it's trying to as hard as those are, or it simply stumbled into being immaculately cogent. it's one of those instinctive, self-apparently awe-inspiring, gorgeous movies. i'll save the rest for when i think about it better.</p>

        <p><span class="i">coraline</span> and <span class="i">ponyo</span> stick out the most besides that overdue rewatch; i had seen the former years ago, and it was even better coming back to when i'm able to pick apart what it all means, and the latter has been in the back of my mind for a while to finally get to. <span class="i">coraline</span> isn't even far and away the better of the two; despite the lack of perceived service for non-children in <span class="i">ponyo</span>, it achieves eye-watering beauty in a way that too feels self-apparent and worthwhile.</p>

        <p><span class="i">the rocky horror picture show</span>, <span class="i">the crow</span>, and <span class="i">clueless</span> were the other three first watches, and <span class="i">the matrix</span> was the fourth re-watching; i think they all kind of speak for themselves in their own ways. i definitely loved coming back to <span class="i">the matrix</span> the most, and <span class="i">the crow</span> was certainly the least compelling in what it tries to say, but the other two were, in uniquely extravagant ways, incredibly fun (confoundingly so in just the right way for the first).</p>

        <p>and while you can just see my <a href="https://letterboxd.com/ceicafera/watchlist" target="_blank">letterboxd watchlist</a>, i'm especially interested in seeing soon <span class="i">promising young woman</span> (in part because it's <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lily_lxndr/film/promising-young-woman" target="_blank">lily alexandre's only half-star review</a>, and it's relatively highly rated overall on letterboxd), <span class="i">anora</span>, <span class="i">dune</span>, <span class="i">come and see</span>, <span class="i">mulholland drive</span>, and i <span class="i">really</span> need to rewatch <span class="i">princess mononoke</span>.</p>

        <h2>music</h2>

        <p>here's the longest section :D</p>

        <p>it always will be, since albums are definitely the primary reason for this existing, and the medium through which i think i can speak (type) in the most useful ways—but i'll try my best never to drag it out, especially since i'm now planning on just linking <a href="https://www.albumoftheyear.org/user/ceicafera/list/285971/everything-i-listened-to-in-november-24/" target="_blank">what i've listened to each month</a> on albumoftheyear instead of rambling about them all.</p>

        <p>i did re-listen to, after a few years, both <span class="i">blue lines</span> by massive attack and <span class="i">long season</span> by fishmans, and the differences between my thoughts on them from then to now are odd. the former was initially a huge disappointment after prior listening to <span class="i">mezzanine</span>, while now it feels more like the spark of a few good songwriting and production ideas that would explode out into much more later on; and the latter used to be one of the most interesting, moody, and expansive short albums i had ever heard, while now it just feels like a set of short, nice-sounding but lacking mood boards of rehashed sounds. i was definitely caught in some wave of internet hype for <span class="i">long season</span> that first time, and i didn't have nearly the same backlog of listening as i do now—and i'd like to be proven wrong about its sound palette being more creatively forward-thinking than it now feels to me—but it's still a kind of loss, that something can wilt so much to my ears.</p>

        <p>but for the sake of time, here are some compacted thoughts on a few of those first listens i had this past month, at least that i haven't review already:</p>

        <ul class="ul1">
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">the new sound</span> – geordie greep</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">as much as i hoped that it would be everything that made <span class="i">black midi</span> such an explosive group project tuned into one man's lovingly weird personality, it did feel like it lacked some in trying to paint the narrative strokes <span class="i">bm</span> did upon a single through line. i think it sounds phenomenal at times, and both <span class="i">blues</span> and <span class="i">holy, holy</span> are obvious highlights, but it holds onto a lot of past styles without <span class="i">meaningfully</span> pushing them forward and as far as they were on <span class="i">hellfire</span> to me.</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">music for the masses</span> – depeche mode</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">both <span class="i">never let me down</span> and <span class="i">nothing</span> have been in heavy rotation for while now; it's synthpop and darkwave done almost menacingly, with enough coldness and anxiety to make it feel like diving into a well, all the while sounding like an anthemic journey.</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">kaleidoscope</span> – turquoisedeath</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2"><span class="i">limbo</span> is really the best thing here, by a mile only for the reason that it builds and builds and builds upon itself spotlessly; atmospheric drum and bass is such a fun style to dive into with that amount of immense attention to detail, and tracks like <span class="i">leviathan sanctuary</span> and <span class="i">underneath</span> pull its repetition in back towards those heights. whoever this is, they're doing incredible work.</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">dark times</span> – vince staples</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">i'm glad that vince finally created something that feels like he put his whole heart into it again. of course, that might be wildly out of touch; <span class="i">when sparks fly</span> off his prior record was far and away his most ingenious track since 2017, and it might be his second most important behind <span class="i">yeah right</span>. but that album, <span class="i">fm!</span>, and his self-titled all felt like they created a mainstream space for him while simultaneously diluting his voice a lot. <span class="i">dark times</span> is the opposite; the message to end is bittersweet, exactly like it was all falling towards.</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">chromakopia</span> – tyler, the creator</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">i'm sorry. i think it's crafted well (how could something tyler produces at this point not be), and a lot of the introspective valleys he digs into are fantastic explorations—but maybe i just need to peer in a bit closer to feel it more. a lot of minutiae tore me away from its purpose(s), and it's hard to battle my inner expectations, and uncloud my judgement, for him to constantly supersede his past work so absolutely like he did with <span class="i">igor</span>. i'll come back to it soon, but i didn't feel it fully, truly well.</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">that total age</span> – nitzer ebb</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">i love loud, sweaty leftist electronic music :D</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">i've seen a way</span> – mandy, indiana</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">i love loud, sweaty leftist electronic music :D</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">post-american</span> – mspaint</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">i mean, i could say the same thing three times... but <span class="i">hardwired</span>, <span class="i">decapitated reality</span>, and the title track are my favorite highlights and they're more digital hardcore than ebm like the last two.</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">gnx</span> – kendrick lamar</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">again, like with <span class="i">chromakopia</span>—it's catchy, the wells are deep, etc., but it doesn't compare really to me. <span class="i">squabble up</span> is anthemic as can be, as is <span class="i">tv off</span>, and i love sza and the two tracks with her inclusions—but i can't see past it just being a set of energy highs without as much in the way, and i like things being in the way.</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">dogsbody</span> – model/actriz</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">without a doubt my favorite noise rock release of this decade, but i guess that's not saying much since i haven't heard much of it. it's just brilliantly disgusting at times, and the explorations, vocally/lyrically and instrumentally are confounding and stunning.</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">dopesmoker</span> – sleep</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">one riff for an hour straight might not be the best concept. maybe stoner metal is not for me. or maybe i should've been high.</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">abyss</span> – chelsea wolfe</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">like <span class="i">dogsbody</span>'s ability to explore love and hate, but even more apocalyptically dark (obviously) and focused on these depressive poems of isolation. i love it, and chelsea's vocal inflections are wonderful, painful mixings with what's surrounding her.</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">unknown pleasures</span> – joy division</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">i'm surprised that the reaction i had when i 'listened' to this first, refusing to think about it more for the sake of my mental health at the time, has now just become a general appreciation for ian curtis's voice and the band's fittingly toned backdrops. i'm both happy that i can listen to really, really good music more, but i'm scared for what that means for my willingness to delve here more. maybe there's a reason no track has been repeated since, yet again.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>i'm also really excited for both <span class="i">eusexua</span> by fka twigs and <span class="i">perverts</span> by ethel cain next year though, and i'm also patiently waiting (as best i can) for whatever jane remover has up her sleeves next. also <span class="i">jeans</span> by 2hollis is fantastic :></p>

        <h2>tv shows</h2>

        <p>i rewatched <span class="i">chernobyl</span> for the expertly choreographed disaster cinema, and it was everything i remembered it to be. on the complete other hand, i watched the first episode of <span class="i">black mirror</span> and i can't imagine ever having thinking there was something to it. i'm scared to watch <span class="i">fifteen million merits</span> or <span class="i">san junipero</span> or especially <span class="i">hated in the nation</span> at this point, because looking back their synopses give exactly the wrong kind of impression, particularly with the 'ooh bad screen' mess that i've come to associate with the whole show now. maybe i should leave them be just to keep their original memories, instead of watching them with new eyes.</p>

        <p>i'm also now halfway through <span class="i">nana</span> (which is amazing but in a simple way), halfway through <span class="i">atlanta</span> season 4 (which is just very good so far, s/o d'angelo), and i've had <span class="i">blue planet</span> as nice background material after giving up on <span class="i">house</span> at season 7 (sorry owen) and <span class="i">adventure time</span> at season 3 for the time being.</p>

        <p>for some reason it's become hard for me to finish a season of a show compared to back in september and october, but at least what i have watched is a nice range and well produced—and <span class="i">veneno</span>, <span class="i">dororo</span>, and <span class="i">arcane</span> are on my immediately following list.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>that was all a lot in hindsight, and i hope that this and other comments morph into more than just fun half-reviews, but it's still fun at least; non-postcards are definitely for the little things i have that aren't directed at any one piece of media, so we'll see how that goes :)</p>
