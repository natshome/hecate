        <p>this one is the black sheep of the bunch so far. i mean, it's not like i wanted it to be, but.. it certainly gives it a bit more character comparatively. and who knows? maybe this ends up being closer to the effort format i like better, closer to an abstracted series on what i've seen this past month here, instead of breaking everything up, linking so much, etc. etc.</p>

        <p>the reason why is uni, obviously- or, to me at least. so while it certainly hasn't been very active here, i at least i made <a href="../../../../../index.html">my home page</a> look real nice. & no hints, but i'll need to change the link to here soon. might need an extra semester though, so.. possibly more delays unfortunately.</p>

        <p>anyways, that's really all i had <span class="i">not</span> related to what i saw this past month—but i think i should mention books, tv & podcasts (woah, we're back for some reason&nbsp;??) here instead of with sections. mainly because i only read ch4-5 of <span class="i">middlemarch</span> (again, uni), and—while it's definitely significant that i'm trying to listen to podcasts again—i only so far have listened to the first episode of <span class="i">ologies</span> with alie ward. so i'll spare any thoughts for now. also, while i started <span class="i">jojo's bizarre adventure</span> and continued <span class="i">adventure time</span> s6 again, it's only been a couple episodes each; <span class="i">breezy</span> is an incredible episode of the latter.</p>

        <p>just wanted to highlight those :) at least before:</p>

        <h2>games</h2>

        <p>i mean, i probably could've separated this out too, but i've already started typing; i likely played the last of <span class="i">balatro</span> that i'll consistently enjoy since i don't have any more motivation to, and i got back into actually trying to play <span class="i">enter the gungeon</span> properly.. then it's just been <span class="i">minecraft</span>, a game of train on <span class="i">cs2</span> (which made me remember why train is <span class="i">such</span> a good map), and a little <span class="i">pokémon platinum</span>. but i feel stuck with the last specifically; idk if resetting is the option, or if i'm just not built for games at the point of my life.</p>

        <h2>movies</h2>

        <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://letterboxd.com/ceicafera/" target="_blank">link to my letterboxd</a></p>

        <p>the only movies that i know i won't really have much to say on from april were <span class="i">star wars: the force awakens</span>, <span class="i">pusher</span>, <span class="i">42</span>, <span class="i">1408</span> (which i technically rewatched from high school times), and <span class="i">fury</span>; i'm sure i have enough in me to complain about them all in different ways, the first and third with the most amount of grace though. i rewatched both <span class="i">princess mononoke</span> and <span class="i">12 angry men</span> too and remember why both of them are so gorgeous and rewarding.. but the real 'highlights' were <span class="i">a minecraft movie</span> and <span class="i">the zone of interest</span>. for surprisingly similar reasons. i will elaborate eventually.</p>

        <p>& i feel like i should i skip over concrete thoughts for <span class="i">12 years a slave</span>; not because it isn't worth talking about, but because everything it conjures is so important that i know i don't have all the knowledge to say; i can't tell to what degree(s) it is important as representing that specific era, or to what degree it is black pain for white tourists. i don't know, and i don't want to presume without fully realizing, with only one viewing. but it will likely be only one viewing for a <span class="i">long</span> time.</p>

        <h2>music</h2>

        <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.albumoftheyear.org/user/ceicafera/list/338285/everything-i-listened-to-in-april-25/" target="_blank">link to my aoty list of everything</a></p>

        <p>this past month was far and away so far the best month of music i've lived through in real time, knowing what was going on. i'm so glad i was here for some of the most important music i've ever experienced.</p>

        <ul class="ul1">
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">product</span> – sophie</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">don't know how i could've been so wrong on my prior last full listen of this to think that it was only a high 3 / 5 ... reprehensible opinion. i have improved.</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">f*ck u skrillex you think ur andy warhol but ur not!! <3</span> – skrillex</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">i came back to a bit from <span class="i">quest for fire</span>, and his early stuff with <span class="i">bangarang</span> and <span class="i">scary monsters...</span>, and i still can't completely conceptualize <span class="i">why</span> this is so much better than those to me (though only moderately better than <span class="i">quest</span>), especially when it reinterpolates so much of the style of that brostep atmosphere. maybe it's the personality. maybe it's just smokey.</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">i didn't mean to haunt you</span> – quadeca</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">this requires a closer eye; i only had my jaw drop to <span class="i">house settling</span> with danny brown—and maybe i need to be more (or less?) happy to let it feel like it's unraveling something.. for now it's simply some well-produced indietronica.</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">revengeseekerz</span> – jane remover</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2"><span class="i">hold me 'cause i feel my head splitting</span></li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">tonight</span> – pinkpantheress</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">was rly nice hearing <span class="i">dazegxd</span> play this in columbus; it's such an infectious, further reinvention for her, constantly doing mini shifts in sound while keeping her aesthetic and artistic visions interesting</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">star</span> – 2hollis</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">i mean.. it's not a disappointment? but it's definitely not the best thing to happen to electronic music the day it came out</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">clube da esquina</span> – milton nascimento & lô borges</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">i wish i had a stronger reaction to this, like i did with construção; maybe it just needs more and more space over time for me to feel connected to it & thru it</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">more chaos</span> – ken carson</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">if this was a little bit less bloated and he had a little bit more to say.. this would likely be incredible; <span class="i">xposed</span> and <span class="i">blakk rockstar</span> to <span class="i">dismantled</span> are some of the best pure rage tracks—though the beat switches are certainly just a bit.. lazy sometimes</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">bitches brew</span> – miles davis</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">one of the best ever album covers for one of the best ever albums</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">los thuthanaka</span> – los thuthanaka</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">this might not be the greatest realized conception of an album i've heard yet, but it <span class="i">has</span> completely changed my views on art and what it means to make it. i will always come back to it, it is transcendent in a way i cannot describe (yet).</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">none so vile</span> – cryptopsy</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">i might just not get it? like the instrumentals are deranged, and i couldn't imagine not-extreme vocals being necessary to 'make it work', but.. i just can't listen to too much all at once—and maybe that's the best compliment, because it was <span class="i">such</span> an intense experience</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">in the aeroplane over the sea</span> – neutral milk hotel</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">similar to <span class="i">deathconsciousness</span> for me of minor flatness at times, but at least i can hear it come through a lot more here; it feels more shockingly esoteric, and that kinda stuff hits for me; the title track is amazing melancholy</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">sisterhood</span> – lucy bedroque</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">digicore with intense emotional bearing, without the ear fatigue; it might have a little bit too much of the same repeated <span class="i">sometimes</span>, but the execution of it as a set of statements is fascinating, and i love it so much<br>also incredibly humbling that they were born in '06, insane.. :c</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">poplife</span> – umru & underscores</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">so i don't think this is anything new but.. the two people helming it and the person behind the art direction are clearly carrying a torch in <span class="i">such</span> a beautiful way~ and i love them all for it dearly</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">street worms</span> – viagra boys</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">now <span class="i">that's</span> a sport 😎</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">the wagoner</span> – sematary & ghost mountain</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">worst sample usage of all time on the last track</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="l1"><span class="i">this is just a dream (and soon i will awake)</span> – d0llywood1</li>
            <ul class="ul2">
              <li class="l2">i thought that i could take or leave all the sound effects, but they really make everything made around them stick just a bit longer. i like the dichotomy. it makes the life breathed thru it a bit more entrenched, a bit more maudlin.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <p>that's all. i'll have something of substance back after my last day on the 8th—or maybe the 11th if that's the deadline for final grades..</p>
