      <div class="blxdescription">any list like this is going to be painfully subjective‚Äîso my goal instead is simply to add songs when they become something notably greater to me, when it reaches some personally significant point to where each song will forever be tied to something more visceral than it is 'logical'. this can be and often is for a myriad of reasons; this list already is intensely broad in what emotions each song stirs, even if themes repeat more often than not. i've also included an added indicator ü™ô for when they paralyze me in awe on their first play-through.<br><span class="i small">replacement addition from 5 may 2025:</span><br>it is hard to add perpetually to something so concrete when feelings shift so greatly, so quickly. while i used to never remove songs from this list, i've come to realize that process is coercing to itself, is skewed against what i wish to show. i used to want to make this a list that displayed where i used to be and where i am now, in what i value the most in the music i hear, but it is, now, more of a continuous, ever-updating process of curation. so it makes sense why this is so disjointed, why there may occasionally be a peak that is eventually filed away.<br>though it is certainly much less likely to be temporary if i have the guts to attempt to describe what makes them so special. and who knows, maybe i will add the old ones back sometimes. their places are still reserved, just hidden from view, at least without a little work.<span class="i small listinto">written 29 jul 2024</span></div>
